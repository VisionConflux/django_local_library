# MDN Library Notes

#Things needed
- Clone from Github
- import of required modules or encounter errors(Instructions aid with this)
- make migrations
- migrate
- python3 manage.py runserver
- navigate to /admin page(may need to create superuser with manage.py)
- login with superuser details
- To change state, add or remove from the models available
-

Without the migrations the models are not properly available and the site would run but without those needed models
